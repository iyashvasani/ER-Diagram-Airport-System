## ER stands for Entity Relationship 

### What is an ER diagram?

An Entity **Relationship (ER)** Diagram is a type of flowchart that illustrates
how “entities” such as people, objects or concepts relate to each other within
a system. ER Diagrams are most often used to design or debug relational databases 
in the fields of software engineering, business information systems, education and 
research. Also known as ERDs or ER Models, they use a defined set of symbols such as 
rectangles, diamonds, ovals and connecting lines to depict the interconnectedness of 
entities, relationships and their attributes. They mirror grammatical structure, with 
entities as nouns and relationships as verbs.
